# FLOURISH
A custom tool for Renoise, used to create strums, flourishes, ripples, arpeggios, etc

# TO_DO
- Implement tension in strums (logarithmic distribution of notes)
- Add ability to strum to/from the first/last note in the line interchangeably

# Under Consideration
- Remove the clearing of the line being flourished, allowing it to be edited mid-flourish and be restored non-destructively
